Diffenrence between Http1 and Http2
Http1;
It uses works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.
These are the drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2: The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. 
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive.
 all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.


Http 2;
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.It uses HPACK for data compression.
HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. 
HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. 
it compresses the header. 
The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.

2)write a blog about object and its internal representation

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type in JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
there are three ways to create object.this object is copy by refernce value.
if anything we alternate values in the object it copy by total address in the memories called temporal dead zone.
1)object literal
2)creating instant of object directly
3)using an object as constructor
